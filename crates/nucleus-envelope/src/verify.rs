//! [`verify_bundle`] — re-validate a [`Bundle`] against a caller-supplied
//! [`TrustAnchor`].
//!
//! # Trust model (read this before using)
//!
//! The bundle's embedded `jwks` is **producer-controlled material**. An
//! attacker who fabricates a whole bundle generates their own keypair,
//! signs whatever edges they like, and ships the matching JWKS — every
//! signature, hash chain, and membership check passes against the
//! bundle's *own* claims.
//!
//! Therefore `verify_bundle` requires a [`TrustAnchor`] that names *which*
//! issuers the verifier trusts out-of-band:
//!
//! - [`TrustAnchor::from_jwks(trusted)`] — verifier supplies a JWKS they
//!   obtained through some authenticated side channel (file under
//!   `chmod 400`, OIDC discovery, signed bundle from operator). Edges
//!   must verify against this JWKS, not the one inside the bundle. The
//!   embedded JWKS is ignored.
//! - [`TrustAnchor::self_check_only()`] — explicit opt-in to "validate the
//!   envelope against the JWKS it carries." Proves the bundle is
//!   *internally consistent*; does NOT prove the producer is who they
//!   claim to be. The [`VerificationReport`] flags this mode so downstream
//!   code can refuse to treat it as a provenance claim.

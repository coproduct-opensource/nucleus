  UniformPrimitive  —  the proof-token as the SAME construct at every layer.

  **STATUS: SPINE PROVEN (0 `sorry`, 0 axiom in `preserves_seq`); GAP 1
  (policy⇝ocap) DISCHARGED as a theorem; 3 layer bridges remain named axioms =
  the machine-checked distance-to-done.** Mathlib-free, Lean 4 v4.30.0-rc2,
  `autoImplicit = false`.

  # What this file is

  The nucleus North Star made "an unmediated external effect is unconstructable"
  structurally true at the AGENT-POLICY layer: every effect is minted only through
  a sealed `DischargedBundle` (`crates/nucleus-ifc-kernel/src/discharge.rs`). The
  standing initiative asks whether that SAME proof-token discipline can hold at
  EVERY layer down to hardware — policy -> ocap/effect language -> an
  NI-preserving compiler -> a verified kernel/hypervisor -> CHERI capability
  hardware -> ISA model, bottoming out "modulo hardware".

  The correct target criterion is NOT full abstraction (it preserves observational
  equivalence — stronger than needed and harder). Non-interference is a
  *hypersafety* property; the criterion that robustly preserves it against
  ARBITRARY adversarial contexts is **Robust Hypersafety Preservation** (Abate et
  al., *Journey Beyond Full Abstraction*). Nucleus's threat model ("assume the
  agent/context is compromised") IS the "robust" quantifier. And robust
  preservation is known to compose VERTICALLY (PF-RSC; Patrignani-Garg): if every
  pass preserves, the whole pipeline preserves. `preserves_seq` below is exactly
  that theorem; `end_to_end` chains it across the five-layer stack.

  # The uniform primitive

  `Preserves L L' γ` is the SAME refined construct at each boundary: a proof-token
  witnessing that refinement `γ` carries noninterference from layer `L` to `L'`
  against any adversary admitted at the boundary. It is the layer-general shape of
  `DischargedBundle` (the effect-boundary instance) and of halve's `CertifiedOn`
  (whose `certifiedOn_seq` is the same triangle-composition move over an error band).

  # Honest gaps (why the remaining axioms are load-bearing, NOT vacuous)

  Downstream program spaces and `NI`/compilers (ISA, kernel, hardware) are
  `opaque`, so each remaining bridge axiom is genuinely underivable in-stub (no
  vacuous witness). GAP 1 is now DISCHARGED: the policy⇝ocap layer is modeled
  concretely on the sealed 8-obligation `DischargedBundle` and its bridge is a
  proven, axiom-free theorem. Three bridges remain (ocap⇝ISA, ISA⇝kernel,
  kernel⇝hardware); each becomes a theorem as its layer is modeled, dropping the
  ratchet baseline. Distance-to-done = axiom count = 3.

  # Known scaffold simplifications (disclosed, not hidden)

  * The discharged policy⇝ocap boundary now carries its REAL interface obligation —
    monotonic-attenuation / non-amplification (`interface_policy_ocap`), proven
    axiom-free. Downstream `Pre` (ISA/kernel/hw) remain `True` pending their layer
    models; `preserves_seq` takes each `hpre` as a hypothesis, so no rework is needed.
  * The "unmediated effect is unconstructable" strength is enforced in Rust by the
    effect fn's `_proof: DischargedBundle` PARAMETER (a missing token is a compile
    error). This Lean model abstracts that as: the effect carries a token, and
    ocap-layer NI = the token is complete.
  * The modulo-hardware FLOOR (timing side-channels, only observable at RTL per
    VeriCHERI) lies below the ISA layer and is NOT covered by any NI theorem here;
    it is a permanent honest caveat, not a bridge to be closed.

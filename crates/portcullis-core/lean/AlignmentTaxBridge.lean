/-! # Alignment Tax = rank H¹: the operational–structural bridge

`alignmentTaxH1` is already defined as `reducedCechDim P indices 1` (the
structural / Čech-cohomological invariant). That identity is a **definition**,
not a theorem.

The **holy-grail conjecture** from `project_alignment_tax_conjecture.md`
asserts a non-trivial bridge between two *independently motivated* notions:

* **Operational** (this file's `operationalAlignmentTax`):
    the minimum number of declassification edges required to realise full
    capability under an IFC policy. Operationally meaningful — counts
    mandatory policy relaxations.

* **Structural** (`alignmentTaxH1`):
    the rank of reduced Čech H¹ of the IFC presheaf. Structural — counts
    independent obstructions to gluing local sections.

The conjecture is that these coincide:

    operationalAlignmentTax = rank H¹

This is the Rice's-theorem / Shannon-bound for AI security: it pins the
tax exactly, proving that each independent cohomology class corresponds
to exactly one mandatory declassification and vice-versa.

## Proof strategy

1. **Upper bound** (`operationalTax ≤ rank H¹`): build an explicit
   declassification set from a basis of H¹ cocycles. Each cocycle pins
   one obstruction; declassifying it kills the class.

2. **Lower bound** (`operationalTax ≥ rank H¹`): any declassification set
   that realises the task must hit every H¹ class (by dimension counting
   on the cocycle space, via rank-nullity from `RankNullity.lean`).

Both directions are classical in the sheaf-theoretic literature (Laudal,
Stacks Project §21); the formal content is assembling them against the
List-based `gaussRankBool` encoding.

## Prior art

* Baudot–Bennequin 2015 (*Entropy*): entropy is the universal H¹ cocycle
  of an information structure. Connects semantic content of H¹ classes
  to Shannon-entropy quantities.
* Vigneaux 2017: information cohomology as a derived functor; H¹ equals
  relative homological information classes under connexity/richness.
* OGPSA (2026): empirical alignment tax via orthogonal gradient projection;
  subspace-geometry mirror of the H¹ picture.

## Current status

This file states the bridge. Proving it is the research frontier.

/-! ## Cohomological-rank semantics for `Realises`

The original `Realises` predicate above (every C¹ entry covered) is the
*combinatorial* version. It's correct as an existence witness but loose:
it requires `|L| ≥ |C¹|` rather than `|L| ≥ rank H¹`. The genuine
bridge theorem needs the *cohomological* version below: `L` realises
iff augmenting `δ⁰` with `L`'s indicator rows kills H¹.

Under this stronger predicate, `operationalTax_ge_h1` follows from rank
subadditivity (`gaussRankBool_append_le`): augmenting δ⁰ by `|L|` rows
increases its rank by at most `|L|`, so to push H¹ to 0 one needs
`|L| ≥ rank H¹`. -/

/-- The C¹-indicator row of a declassification edge.

    For an edge `(f, t, p)`, the row has `true` exactly at C¹ entries
    `(i, j, q)` matching the edge in either direction (i.e., `q = p`
    and `{i, j} = {f, t}`), `false` elsewhere. This is the cohomological
    "kill the obstruction at `(f, t, p)`" generator. -/

    Any cohomologically-realising declassification set has cardinality at

    subadditivity of `gaussRankBool` under row append (from `RankNullity`).

    the lower bound of the Alignment Tax Theorem. -/

/-! ## Upper bound and the holy-grail equality

The lower bound says any cohomologically-realising L has |L| ≥ rank H¹.
The upper bound says there *exists* such an L of size exactly rank H¹ —
a transversal of the H¹ quotient space.

This is classical linear algebra (any quotient of finite-dim space has
a basis), but our List-encoded matrices need direct formalization. We
state it as a clean axiom; combined with the lower bound, this gives the
**Alignment Tax Theorem**: `operationalTax = rank H¹`. -/

/-- **Basis transversal existence**: there is a list of declassification
    edges of length exactly `rank H¹` that realises `RealisesH1`.

    Classical linear algebra: pick a basis of the H¹ quotient and
    represent each basis element as an indicator-row declass edge.

    Stated as a sorry; the structural proof requires extracting a basis
    from the gaussRankBool elimination. The fact is true for any finite
    GF(2)-cohomology theory. -/

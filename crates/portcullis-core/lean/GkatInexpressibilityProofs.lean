# Toward inexpressibility: the loop derivatives all halt on ¬b (the D.2 `^(b)` crux)

Route B to the first GKAT inexpressibility (Fig. 3 of Schmid–Kappé–Kozen–Silva, ICALP
2021). Their **Lemma D.2**: every infinite branch of a GKAT behavior is *finitely
alternating* — it cannot have `E(∂_w t)=b` and `E(∂_w t)=b̄` both infinitely often.
Fig. 3's b/b̄-alternating 2-cycle violates this, so it is denoted by no expression.

**Finitization.** `⟦e⟧` has finitely many derivatives (`derivs`, Lemma F.1), so an
infinite branch must cycle; the ω-property reduces to a **cycle** property of the
finite derivative automaton `⟨E, next⟩`. No coinductive trees are needed.

D.2's proof inducts on `e`; the `^(b)` (loop) case is the crux, and it is exactly our
`InLoop_exits_on_not_b` generalized to *all* loop derivatives: **every derivative of
`e^(b)` accepts only on `¬b`-atoms** (`E(e^(b)) = ¬b`, and any derivative is
`e'·e^(b)` with `E = E(e')∧¬b ⊆ ¬b`). Hence no cycle inside a loop can ever reach an
`E=b` state — the loop's branches are finitely alternating (never `b` at all). This
file machine-checks that crux.

/-- **The `^(b)` crux of Lemma D.2.** Every derivative of a loop `e^(b)` accepts only
    on `¬b`-atoms: if a derivative `e'` of `.wh b e` halts at atom `a` (`E(e')` holds),
    then `b` is false at `a`. So along any branch that stays inside the loop, the
    acceptance condition never equals `b` — the branch cannot alternate `b`/`b̄`. This
    generalizes `InLoop_exits_on_not_b` from the loop head to all its derivatives. -/

    bval V b a = false := by

  rcases h with rfl | ⟨e'', _, rfl⟩

  · -- e' = e''·e^(b):  E = E(e'') ∧ ¬b
    simp only [E, bval, Bool.and_eq_true] at hE
    simpa using hE.2

/-- Corollary: a loop `e^(b)` never has a derivative that halts on a `b`-atom. So the
    set of atoms any loop-derivative accepts on is disjoint from `b` — the finite,
    `derivs`-level shadow of "no branch of `⟦e^(b)⟧` accepts `b` infinitely often". -/

  cases h' : bval V (E e') a with
  | false => rfl
  | true => rw [loop_deriv_halts_on_not_b V h h'] at hb; exact absurd hb (by simp)

/-- **The loop case of D.2, in strong form.** No two derivatives of a loop `e^(b)`
    (with `b` satisfiable) accept on *complementary* atom-sets. So a loop's cycle can
    never contain a state accepting exactly on `c` and one accepting exactly on `c̄` —
    the finite obstruction to the b/b̄-alternation of Figure 3. Both derivatives accept
    only on `¬b`-atoms (`loop_deriv_no_halt_in_b`); at a `b`-atom `a₀` both reject, but
    complementarity forces one to accept there. -/

  Integrity Noninterference — proven OVER the Aeneas-EXTRACTED enforcement core.

  **STATUS: DRAFT / build-unverified.** The `#print axioms` commands at the
  bottom of this file emit the real axiom set to the CI log when the
  `lean-build` job runs against a v4.30.0-rc2 Mathlib cache. As of commit time
  that build had NOT been run, so the printed axiom set is UNCONFIRMED — do not
  read the expected `[propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice]` as verified until
  the CI log shows it.

  This is the order-dual integrity-axis noninterference theorem, RE-PROVEN over
  the Aeneas-generated (from real Rust) definitions instead of a hand-written
  model. The chain is:

      crates/portcullis-core/src/extracted/ifc_integrity.rs   (real Rust)
        --charon (scoped, --start-from)-->  portcullis_core.llbc
        --aeneas -backend lean -split-files-->
          generated-ifc/PortcullisCoreIFC/{Types,Funs}.lean    (THIS file's deps)
        --(this file)-->  noninterference theorem over THOSE generated defs.

  The generated functions live in namespace `portcullis_core` and return the
  Aeneas `Result` monad. We prove every theorem in terms of THOSE functions
  (`extracted.ifc_integrity.{irank,imeet,iflows_to,irun_step}`), not a hand
  model. The only hand-written piece is the op-list fold `irun` (Aeneas does
  not extract the runtime's loop — slices are outside the scoped subgraph), and
  each fold step calls the GENERATED `irun_step`/`imeet`.

  # Ground truth this file is proven over (and the Rust↔model parity)

  The generated defs mirror the production enforcement (see the EXHAUSTIVE
  parity tests in `src/extracted/ifc_integrity.rs`, which assert the extracted
  `imeet`/`iflows_to`/`irank` equal the integrity axis of the real
  `IFCLabel::join`/`flows_to` and that `SinkClass::GitPush.required_integrity()
  = Trusted`). Those Rust tests close the model↔code gap; THIS file closes the
  property-over-extracted gap.

  # Scope boundary (the honest single-axis caveat)

  `IFCLabel::flows_to` is a CONJUNCTION over six axes; this theorem is about the
  INTEGRITY conjunct only. Because failure on one conjunct makes the whole
  `flows_to` false, "integrity alone blocks ⇒ admission denied" is sound. This
  is NOT the full multi-axis admission rule. The fold `irun` is hand-written
  Lean over the GENERATED step; the per-step decision and the admission check
  are the generated-from-Rust functions.

  Axiom audit. These commands print the FULL transitive axiom set the kernel
  used to accept each theorem. The CI `lean-build` job captures their real
  output to the log. The EXPECTED set is exactly:

      [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice]

  Anything else — in particular `sorryAx` (a proof hole) or any
  Aeneas-emitted opaque `*External` axiom — MUST fail review. The `extracted/`
  Rust deliberately uses an explicit `irank(a) <= irank(b)` comparison rather
  than a derived `Ord`, so Aeneas emits a translated body (no opaque comparison
  axiom); `generated-ifc/` contains no `FunsExternal_Template.lean`, so there
  are no opaque-function holes to leak in here.

  HONESTY NOTE: at the time this file was committed the build had NOT yet run
  on a host with a v4.30.0-rc2 Mathlib cache, so the ACTUAL printed axiom set
  was UNVERIFIED. Do not treat the expected list above as confirmed until the
  CI log shows it.
